        üìå What is HTML?
        <br>
        HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web
        applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you
        click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link
        two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

        Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
        conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into
        images, tables, links, etc.

        Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page
        can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML
        only, we can create static web pages.

        üåè History of HTML
        <br>
        Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief introduction about the
        HTML version is given below:

        HTML 1.0: The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version of HTML language, and it was
        released in 1991.

        HTML 2.0: This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was standard language version for website
        design. HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such as form-based file upload, form elements such as text
        box, option button, etc.

        HTML 3.0: HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version was capable of creating tables and
        providing support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex mathematical
        equations. It became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported
        by most of the browsers.

        HTML 4.0: HTML 4.01 version was released on December 1999, and it is a very stable version of HTML language.
        This version is the current official standard, and it provides added support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting
        ability for various multimedia elements.

        HTML 5.0: HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first draft of this version was
        announced in January 2008. There are two major organizations one is W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and another
        one is WHATWG(Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) which are involved in the development of HTML
        5 version, and still, it is under development.
